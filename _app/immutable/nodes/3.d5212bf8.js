Throughout the
		year, club members will learn various algorithms and practice implementing them by solving real
		competitive programming problems. With the help of our qualified mentors, club members will
		prepare for coding contests such as USACO (USA Computing Olympiad) and other prestigious online
		competitions. Join us and boost your critical thinking and coding skills!</p>`,_,g,k=`<h1 class="text-5xl font-bold m-5">Why Join</h1> <p class="sm:px-10 m-5 text-lg font-semibold">Joining Tino Competitive Programming is a great oppurtunity that brings many benefits. Our club
		helps prepare students for school courses such as Intro to Java and APCS, as well as learning
		beyond the school&#39;s scope. Competitive Programming is a great was to boost college applications
		and gain skills for coding interviews. You will be able to greatly improve your programming
		speed, knowledge of useful algorithms and data structures, logical thinking and problem solving.
		It will teach you a lot about programming in general and will put you on a path towards success
